            Perfection itself is a flaw. To question how could anything originate out of it’s 
            opposite in a strictly rhetorical sense would be the blind man feeling up a horse’s leg 
            and not being able to tell it’s actually his dick. The belief in antithesis of values is 
            a narrowing one, for in this two-dimensional world; a thing is either good or bad, for 
            if it is both it is bad, and if it is neither it is bad. The concept that good and 
            bad(both as inherent ideas and practical notions) are closer than inbred Alabamian cousins 
            makes an idealist’s skin crawl more than even the concept of incest(or itself as a practical 
            notion) does. In an idealist’s world(and note that I don’t say ‘an idealistic world’) what 
            he sees is mere fiction. He sees a world created by the mind, and he sees another perfect, 
            beautiful, good, true, virtuous world that exists outside our creations(or visions). A world 
            achievable by following this and that commandment. Purging this or that malicious desire, 
            envy, flaw. This is the most dreadful of all beliefs. This is what is truly pessimistic. 

            And to quote the man himself, to recognize untruth as a condition of life is to transcend 
            the concepts of good and evil.

            In a sick, twisted fashion; it is the idealist who brings into reality his idealistic world. 
            When he creates morals that can’t be upheld, laws that are prejudiced and freedoms that are 
            illusionary, he creates a world based on these beautiful lies and blames it on people when 
            they fail him. To disregard the narrowing effect of time (or instead, the perception of it) 
            in submerging the canvas of reality into half observable pictures devoid of motion, this 
            idealist baffles at himself for being the only one with good intentions, and failing so 
            miserably at making an impact.

            When it comes to objectivity and truth(terms that are NOT polar opposites) it is often claimed 
            that this and that has figured out the singular truth of all life in the universe. And moreover 
            foolishly, he claims that he has reached this conclusion with no insertion of self in the 
            process. May I ask you, what even is left… without the insertion of self?  And what even is 
            this objective truth they speak of?

            The sun will rise. Is this an objective truth? (Fuck you, one day it won’t)

            The fate of everything is death. Is this an objective truth? (What is the death of death?)

            Time exists. Is this an objective truth? (Does it? On a planet that no one has ever seen 
            and no one will ever see?)
            
            Of course, the last example only is rendered by the deafening limitations of a species. 
            But aren’t so, the rest of them? Isn’t truth, what can be observed? Isn’t existence what 
            can be observed? (In actuality, it is a bit more complicated, as observability is also 
            a matter of perspective) With this, I present to you, the observable truth. 
            Everything is created with a hint of its opposite in it. Either be the universe of matter 
            and anti-matter, the yin of yang, or the so-called truth and lies. 

            The inherent drive of all existence, is to vent its strength. If it were only the basic 
            and primal drive to survive (and in extension procreate) why then, would we sacrifice, 
            or act out in the fashion of voluntary death? (To die, thus, is the best death)  A thing 
            kills itself to vent its strength, it fights to vent its strength and runs to vent its strength. 
            Everything that exists always seeks proof of its existence. Even in the face of hopelessness, 
            it wants to feel alive.

            There is no single truth.

            There is no hierarchy of power.
            
            Above all, it is necessary to abide by the rules, no matter how outlandish or grounded, 
            that one sets upon himself. And if he loses himself in being able to do so, either his beliefs 
            are too demanding (in which case, he must find comfort in being a simpleton) or the man is weak willed. 
            He must pay his penance, which will also be decided by him, and change his code. 

            And it is necessary to never set said rules, or any, on anyone other than you.

            There is no middle ground.

            Everything, no matter how big or little, holds only the significance you decide to provide it with. 

            In that, you are a god.

            Destroyer of worlds.
